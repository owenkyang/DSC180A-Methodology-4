**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in our domain this quarter is learning about how different climate agents such as aerosol impact our world's climatology. It is interesting to see how aerosal actually has benefits towards global warming (even though it is terrible for air quality). We have gone over the simulations and forecasting with the scenario if we were to increase the aerosol levels in the world and we saw that our surface temperature drastically dropped. We even went over the scenario if our world's surface temperature becomes too hot, what would happen if we were to release a bunch of aerosol in a place that is not populated such as in the middle of the ocean. It was quite interesting to see and learn about these different scenarios/simulations that researchers in climate are considering.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for Quarter 2 is investigating if cities will become submerged underwater under different scenario. For example, it would be cool to see if Venice will still be submerged underwater in 50 years if we were to release more aerosol into our atmosphere. It would be a cool visualization to see and even awakening to see how damaged our planet is getting.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change we would make is to do more application for our models than we have in the quarter 1 project. In our quarter 1 project, we just create these models to see how well they perform and compare them to one another, but we do not apply them to anything. For our quarter 2 project, it would be really cool to apply these models to some sort of visualization so that viewers can get a really good sense of what happens to our world's climatology.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Exploring dynamic visualization technqiues that is both easily interpretable by the viewer and visually pleasing at the same time. It would be really interesting to do a deep dive on visualization libraries such as D3 and learn more about JavaScript/TypeScript to support our quarter 2 project.
